              <h2>introduction</h2>
              <p>as my senior capstone project, i chose to combine my passion for data and my experience in sync licensing to create this project! i analyzed the relationship between music genres and TV show genres in sync licensing. by leveraging data analytics, the project identifies patterns in successful music placements and develops an algorithm to help music supervisors and artists make more informed decisions about sync opportunities. the ultimate goal is to create a recommendation platform that streamlines the music selection process for media productions while helping artists gain strategic exposure. <b>this is a project that is still a work in progress, but this is what i've been up to!</b>

                <li>1. gathered a list from <a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/best-tv-shows-song-synchs-most-valuable/">this billboard article</a> to start my search on the most popular used songs in the most popular TV shows.</li>
                <li>2. compiled that into one big spreadsheet</li>

          <h2>conclusion</h2>
          <p>although this is still an "in the works" project, i am excited to continue working on it and hope to present it to the world one day! i've definitely been challenged in working with all this data, but it's been a great learning experience that has helped me grow. by identifying patterns in successful sync placements and developing algorithmic recommendations, the project creates value for multiple stakeholders while potentially improving the quality and efficiency of music selection for media productions. the approach combines technical data analysis with creative industry knowledge, resulting in practical applications that could significantly impact how music is selected for TV shows. as the platform develops further, i hope it has the potential to become an essential tool for music supervisors and a strategic resource for artists seeking sync opportunities.</p>
