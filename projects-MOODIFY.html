    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>moodify, an app designed to transform the way you experience music by creating custom playlists that match your mood, activity, and personal tastes. leveraging data from streaming platforms, moodify tailors playlists to seamlessly fit any situtation.
    </p>
    <h3>the challenge</h3>
    <b>mood subjectivity</b>
    <ul>
        <li>moods are interpreted differently whereas one song can evoke different moods/feelings in multiple subjects </li>
    </ul>
    <b>data quality</b>
    <ul>
        <li>more users are needed to have a better end result</li>
    </ul>
    <b>limited catalog</b>
    <ul>
        <li>if the app's library is limited, users may receive repetitive or irrelevant recommneations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>process</h3>
    <p>our objective was to create an application to integrate exploration, emotional regulation, productivity enhancement, and entertainment value into your listening playlist by implementing the spotify profile and using a comprehensive database
    with such little time to prepare this product, i went straight into the process of designing and prototyping the product. i decided to go with a simple, to-the-point design where users would be abelt o understand the flow of the product. 
    this was the ultimate product that we presented.

    <h3>takeaways</h3>
   
        <u>future appliations</u>
        <p>dsp data extension</p>
        <ul>
        <li>would allow the app to leverage streaming data for more personalized and dynamic playlist curation</li>
        <li>integrating with dsps like spotify, apple music, or amazon music, this application could access user listening data</li>
        </ul>
        <u>building community</u>
        <ul>
        <li>create a vibrant community of music lovers who share their experiences, discover new music, and connect with each other based on their moods and activities</li>
        <li>whether that is through discussion forums or collaborative playlists, users would be able to create this sense of belonging amongst people of like-minded interests</li>
        </ul>
        <u>record label collaboration</u>
        <ul>
        <li>would enhance its content offerings, providing a unique experience for users, and create marketing opportunities that would benefit both the app and the labels</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>my own takeaways</h3>
    <p>this was a project in partnership with the <b>measure of music</b>. we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what ata we used and how we use it. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in implementing the data and create something from that. i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this is something that can be developed into something more!</p>
