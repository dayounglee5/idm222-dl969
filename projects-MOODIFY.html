                <p>with such little time to prepare this product, i went straight into the process of designing and prototyping the product. i decided to go with a simple, to-the-point decision where users would be able to understand the flow of the product. this was the ultimate product that we presented.</p>

                <p>this was my initial design that i had started with. i decided to go with a simple, to-the-point decision where users would be able to understand the flow of the product.because of the limited time, there was no time to create a more complex design, so this is the design that i had ultimately come up with. as someone who had just started to understand prototyping and designing, it was definitely a challenge to design something so quickly. ultimately, i ended up designing something very simple so that users were able to understand how easy it was to go through the process.</p>

                <h2>takeaways</h2>
                <p>we had two days to create an idea to pitch and compose a presentation displaying what data we used and how we used that data. being my first time participating in this conference, it felt daunting because i was not confident in creating a product that implemented all sorts of different data. this was also a project where it was my first time using figma to create a prototype, so it was definitely a challenge for me. but, i enjoyed working with my team, and hopefully this can be something that can be developed into something more!</p>
