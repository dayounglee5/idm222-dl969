    <h1>goodreads redesign</h1>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p><b class="goodreadsbold">goodreads</b> is a popular social cataloging platform for book lovers, allowing users to track their reading, write reviews, and discover new books based on recommendations and community interactions. however, despite its widespread usage, many users feel that the website and app are outdated in terms of design and user experience. the goals of this projects was to explore how a redesign would improve the platform's usability, user engagement, and overall appeal, while retaining its core functionality.</p>
    <h3>tools used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>figma</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>problems with the current website</h3>
    <b>outdated user interface</b>
    <ul>
        <li>the current design felt cluttered and lacked a modern design, such as a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and a strong visual hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
    <b>inefficient shelving and book management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>the process of adding books to shelves and managing “to-read” lists was awkward. there was no easy way for the user to bulk organize and a way to filter or sort their shelves</li>
    </ul>
    <b>weak community interaction</b>
    <ul>
        <li>despite being designed as a social platform, goodreads lacked robust community interaction features. its discussion forums and groups are outdated and hard to navigate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>objective</h3>
    <p>the primary object of the redesign was to modernize the platform, enhance user engagement, and improve the user experience across both web and mobile.</p>
    <h3>target audience</h3>

    <h3>process</h3>
    <u>low fidelty wireframes (mobile)</u>
    <p>this layout focused on a user experience that prioritizes discovering new books while maintaining quick access to the user's reading progress. at the top, a large horizontal carousel allows users to browse featured books easily. below, there's a reading challenge progress bar paired with quick access buttons for "reading," "want to read," and "read" sections, helping users manage their book lists seamlessly.</p>

    <p>this design was focused on helping users discover new books and providing a streamlined experience to easily track their reading challenge progress. the layout features a prominent search bar for quick book look-up, multiple sections of horizontal carousels to explore popular and recommended books, and a dedicated area that highlights the user's reading challenge with a progress bar, making it simple for users to stay motivated and find their next read.</p>

    <h3>solution</h3>
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ALmVHjkc2oxd5nrXl0hq8W/Goodreads-Redesign?node-id=39-1747&t=KyFIL0KUTJTBuu8K-1"><u>click <b>here</b> to view the <b>mobile</b> high fidelity prototype!</u></a>
    <p>i wanted to redesign the goodreads mobile version to be more user-friendly by transforming the homepage into a clean, streamlined hub. this allows users to access the key features that is not very obvious in the current layout, however, with this redesign, users are able to access key features like personlized recommnedations, community updates, and more. by centralizing these features on the homepage, users can easily find what they need, making the platform more accessible and user-friendly. </p><br>

    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ALmVHjkc2oxd5nrXl0hq8W/Goodreads-Redesign?node-id=0-1&t=H8VFnhN4G30zJ2fB-1"><u>click <b>here</b> to view the <b>desktop </b>high fidelity prototype!</u></a>
    <p>the desktop prototype is similar to the mobile prototype, but with a more expanded layout, making it easier for users to find key features like personalized recommendations, community updates, and more. it was a lot easier to highlight the features i wanted to highlight through the desktop version. </p>

    <h3>takeaways</h3>
        <b>impact on users</b>
        <ul>
            <li>users would benefit from a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface, making <b>goodreads</b> a more enjoyable platform for tracking reading and engaging with a like-minded community</li>
            <li>provides a more enjoyable experience with enhanced book discovery and community features</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>next steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>include further research and user testing to refine specific interactions and explore additional features, like integrating with other social media platforms</li>
            <li>additional functionality: more personalized reading goals, interactive reading progress tracking, and dynamic book club management </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>my own takeaways</h3>
    <p>being the first design project i have ever worked on, this was a great learning process for me. i learned the importance of aligning design decisions with both user needs and business goals, teaching me to appreciate the value of design, continuous feedback, and effective communication. i learned to understand why design is so important, and that all because it looks pretty, it's not the most user-friendly.</p>
