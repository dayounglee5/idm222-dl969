        <h1>using data to make successful syncs</h1>
        <h3>introduction: what is this project about?</h3>
        <p>this project is focused to analyze the relationship between specific music genres and genres of TV shows, identifying the most commonly used songs in sync licensing. from this, creating a dashboard to help sync licensing coordinators/music supervisors to help provide insights into what specific genres of music works in specific TV shows.</p>

    <h3>my current progress and challenges</h3>
    <p>initially, my project focus was on TV shows and movies, however, i thought it was best to focus this project on just TV shows for the time being. a big challenge that i had was figuring out a way to pull all that data and exactly where i could find it. i realized TV show data was a lot more prominent and easier to access, so i decided to focus on that.</p>
